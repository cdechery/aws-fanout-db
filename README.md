# fanout
A python app that helps broadcasting SSH keys to many servers in your infrastructure.

-- Still under construction, feel free to add a helping hand in coding or just contributing with ideas --

So, this script was created because if you need to create a user and configure his public SSH key on many servers at once, it can be a pain in the ass to manage it.
With the help of this app, you can manage users and the servers they have access to with the help of a database and a menu to easily add/update user and server information.

Then just RUN FANOUT and watch while all the changes on the database are spread out to all the servers via SSH.
